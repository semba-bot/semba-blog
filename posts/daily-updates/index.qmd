## General blooming and Foliage 
Miombo trees are deciduous, losing most of their leaves during the dry season(winter).The most visually striking period is the late dry season flush in early spring, usually around August and September, just before the onset of the rain. During this time the woodlands are covered by vibrant new foliage of red, orange and yellow hues. This fresh leaf flush not only transforms the landscape visually but also play an important ecological role. Providing a burst of nutrients for herbivores after the nutrient-poor dry season and signaling the start of renewed biological activity in the ecosystems.

These variations mean that while there is  a peak period for a new foliage, the overall blooming of different species can spam much of the year.
