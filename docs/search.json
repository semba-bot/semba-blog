    "text": "Stephano Semba is integrating data science with his conservation background to solve emerging environmental challenges. This skillset is an asset for both his career growth and his institute’s impact. Data science empowers and advances national conservation efforts\n\nEmerging conservation challenges—driven by poverty, agricultural expansion, and demand for timber—are causing significant forest degradation and loss. Data science provides a powerful solution by using computation and analysis to accurately measure forest cover and deliver critical insights to policymakers and institutions."
